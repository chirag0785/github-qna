# GitHub QnA

GitHub QnA is an AI-powered question-answering tool for code repositories.  
It allows developers to query a repository in natural language and get contextual answers along with relevant code snippets.  
This project uses semantic search and embeddings to deliver precise results.

## üì¶ Installation

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chirag0785/github-qna.git
cd github-qna
```

### Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Run the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## üîç How It Works

GitHub QnA leverages AI and vector search to provide precise answers from your code repositories. Here's the workflow:

1. **Embedding Generation**  
   - When you submit a query, GitHub QnA uses Google GenAI's `text-embedding-004` model to convert your natural language query into a numerical vector.  
   - This vector represents the semantic meaning of your query in a form the system can understand.

2. **Vector Search**  
   - The generated query vector is compared against precomputed embeddings stored in PostgreSQL using `pgvector`.  
   - The system identifies the most semantically similar files and code snippets from your repository based on similarity scores.

3. **Answer Generation**  
   - Relevant file contents are retrieved and passed to the AI model.  
   - The AI generates a **contextual answer** to your query, often including **code snippets** and explanations to help you understand the solution.

4. **Invite Team Members**  
   - You can generate a **private project link** to invite team members.  
   - Team members can join using this link and collaborate on queries, access project resources, and view responses in real-time.
